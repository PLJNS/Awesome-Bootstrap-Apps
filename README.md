Awesome Bootstrap Apps 
======================

I always had this little craving to mock-up an app spring board
with some standard apps, just for some fun.

I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to make the actual icons,
and [BrandColors](http://brandcolors.net) for the, well, brand colors.

Big thank you to [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com) and their [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#tab_fontawesome).

How to
------

1. Download, copy-paste, clone `apps.css`
2. Add it to your HTML header.
3. To make a Facebook icon appear, type `<div class="icon facebook-icon"><p><i class="icon-facebook"></i></p></div>`.
    -   If you want LinkedIn, replace all instances of "facebook" with "linkedin".
4. Enjoy!

To do
-----

1. SpringBoard CSS, Bootstrap-grid-like app spring board.
2. Fix CSS gradients on mobile webkit devices.
3. Make it compile with LESS and grabing all overlapping Font Awesome and BrandColors brands.
4. Do all default iOS apps.
