Awesome Apps 
============

I always had this little craving to mock-up an app spring board
with some standard apps, just for some fun.

I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) to make the actual icons,
and [BrandColors](http://brandcolors.net) for the, well, brand colors.

Big thank you to [MaxCDN](http://www.maxcdn.com) and their [Bootstrap CDN](http://www.bootstrapcdn.com/#tab_fontawesome), also the mysterious [iOS 7 Colors](http://ios7colors.com) for help
with gradients.

How to
------

1. Download, copy-paste, clone `apps.css`
2. Add it to your HTML header.
3. Backwards engineer the apps up to with "Inspect element."
	- I'm still not done.
4. Enjoy!

To do
-----

1. SpringBoard CSS, Bootstrap-grid-like app spring board.
2. Make it compile with LESS and grabing all overlapping Font Awesome and BrandColors brands.
3. Do all (possible) default iOS apps.
